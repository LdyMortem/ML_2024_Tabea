To make reasonable buying decision of objects, let those be clothing, a new CPU or even a motorcycle, one has to have 
an approriate price in mind. This might be more or less easy for common items like food and clothing, but a quiet challenging task for more complex and expensive things, like
houses, rare \textbf{PoKÃ©MoN} cards or motorcycles. A potential buyer is almost obligated to invest multiple hours to understand
how the price of an item comes to be and to check if it is approriate in comparison to the market.\\
This is a very tidious task. By using Machine Learning algorithms, using up to date market prices and appropriate attributes, which
influence the price, one can get an appropriate price with minimal time and effort (\textit{at least for the end user}).
When the author of this report was trying to sell her last motorcycle on the internet, she was met with the problem: "\textit{What is the highest possible profit
I could get out of this while not seeming absurd?}". Which brings us to the content of the following report, in which an ensembled model
of multiple regressor model will be used to estimate an appropriate market price according to the age, mileage, brand, model and the
with that connected bike specifications.
