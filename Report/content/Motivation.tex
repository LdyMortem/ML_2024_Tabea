When making buying decision for items such as clothing, a new CPU or even a motorcycle, it is essential to have a clear understanding of
an appropriate price. This might be more or less easy for common items like food and clothing, but a quite challenging task for more complex and expensive things, like
houses, rare \textbf{PoKÃ©MoN} cards or motorcycles. A potential buyer is almost obligated to invest a significant amount of hours to comprehend
an item's price and to check if it is appropriate relative to the market.\\
This is a very tedious task. Using Machine Learning algorithms, up-to-date market prices and appropriate attributes, which
influence the price, one can get an appropriate price with minimal time and effort (\textit{at least for the end user}).
When the author of this report was trying to sell her last motorcycle on the internet, she was faced with the dilemma of determining
the highest possible profit without seeming unreasonable. This dilemma serves as a basis for the following report, in which an ensembled model
of multiple regressor models will be used to estimate an appropriate market price based on factors such as age, mileage, brand, model, and 
respective bike specifications.\\
